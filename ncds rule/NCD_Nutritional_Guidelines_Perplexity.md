## Notes

- **Sugar**: Refers to added/free sugars; WHO recommends <10% total energy, with <5% preferred for diabetes and obesity.
- **Protein**: Higher protein intake benefits weight management and metabolic control.
- **Fat**: Total fat generally <30% of energy (~67g); saturated fat limits vary by condition (see table).
- **Carbohydrates**: Emphasis on quality (low glycemic index for diabetes, DASH pattern for hypertension).
- **Fiber**: At least 25g/day, with emphasis on soluble fiber for cholesterol management.
