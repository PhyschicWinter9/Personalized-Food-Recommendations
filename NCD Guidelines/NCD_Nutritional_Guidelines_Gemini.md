# Daily Nutritional Intake Recommendations for Adults with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)

As a medical dietitian and nutrition expert, I've compiled daily nutritional intake recommendations for adults with specific non-communicable diseases (NCDs), based on a 2000 kcal/day reference. These guidelines are grounded in current scientific evidence from leading health organizations.

## Important Considerations

* **Individualization:** These are general guidelines for a 2000 kcal/day intake. Actual needs can vary significantly based on age, sex, activity level, medications, and individual metabolic responses. For personalized advice, always consult a registered dietitian or healthcare provider.
* **Dietary Patterns:** Focus on adopting healthy eating patterns (like the DASH or Mediterranean diets) that naturally align with these nutrient recommendations, rather than just targeting isolated nutrient numbers.
* **Whole Foods:** Prioritize whole, unprocessed foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
* **Sodium:** While not detailed in the table, limiting sodium intake is crucial for managing hypertension and benefits overall cardiovascular health. The DASH diet typically suggests 2300 mg/day, with an even lower target of 1500 mg/day for greater blood pressure reduction.

## Recommended Daily Nutrient Intakes

| Condition          | Sugar (added/free) (g/day) | Protein (g/day) | Fat (g/day) | Saturated Fat Limit | Total Carbohydrates (CHOCDF) (g/day) | Dietary Fiber (FIBTG) (g/day) |
| :----------------- | :------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **General Adult** | < 25 (5% of total energy)  | 100-175 (20-35% of total energy) | 55-78 (25-35% of total energy) | < 13 (WHO/AHA < 10% or < 6% of total calories for high cholesterol) | 225-275 (45-55% of total energy) | ≥ 28 (14g/1000 kcal)          |
| **Diabetes** | < 25 (5% of total energy)  | 100-175 (20-35% of total energy) | 55-78 (25-35% of total energy) | < 13 (Prioritize unsaturated fats) | 200-275 (Individualized, focus on complex carbs) | ≥ 28                          |
| **Obesity** | < 25 (5% of total energy)  | 100-175 (20-35% of total energy) | 55-78 (25-35% of total energy) | < 13 (Prioritize unsaturated fats) | 225-275 (Focus on whole, unprocessed) | ≥ 28                          |
| **Hypertension** | < 25 (5% of total energy)  | 100-175 (20-35% of total energy) | 55-78 (25-35% of total energy) | < 13 (AHA < 6% of total calories) | 225-275 (Emphasis on whole grains) | ≥ 28                          |
| **High Cholesterol** | < 25 (5% of total energy)  | 100-175 (20-35% of total energy) | 55-78 (25-35% of total energy) | < 13 (AHA < 6% of total calories) | 225-275 (Emphasis on whole grains) | ≥ 28                          |

## Notes on Specific Nutrients and Conditions

* **Sugar (added/free sugar):** The **WHO** recommends limiting free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake, and ideally below 5% for greater health benefits. For a 2000 kcal diet, 5% translates to **25 grams of sugar** (4 kcal/gram). This recommendation is vital across all NCDs for managing weight, blood glucose, and overall metabolic health.
* **Protein:** A range of **20-35% of total energy** is generally advised, which for a 2000 kcal diet is **100-175 grams** (4 kcal/gram protein). This range supports satiety, muscle maintenance, and general health across these conditions. Focus on lean protein sources (plant-based, fish, lean poultry).
* **Fat:** Total fat intake typically falls within **25-35% of total energy**, equating to **55-78 grams** for a 2000 kcal diet (9 kcal/gram fat). The *type* of fat is critical.
    * **Saturated Fat:** Limiting saturated fat is a consistent recommendation for all NCDs, especially for high cholesterol and hypertension. The **American Heart Association (AHA)** suggests reducing saturated fat to **less than 6% of total daily calories** for those needing to lower cholesterol. For a 2000 kcal diet, this is **13 grams of saturated fat**. The WHO also advises keeping saturated fat below 10% of total energy.
    * Prioritize monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (found in olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds, fatty fish) over saturated and trans fats.
* **Total Carbohydrates:** A general range of **45-65% of total energy** is typical, which for a 2000 kcal diet is **225-325 grams** (4 kcal/gram carbohydrate). For individuals with diabetes, the **ADA** emphasizes the *quality* of carbohydrates, focusing on whole, unprocessed, high-fiber options, and individualizing intake based on blood glucose response. The lower end of the range (225g) or even lower might be considered for some individuals with diabetes or obesity aiming for more significant glycemic control or weight loss, provided nutrient adequacy is maintained.
* **Dietary Fiber:** The **USDA Dietary Guidelines** recommend **14 grams of dietary fiber per 1,000 calories**. For a 2000 kcal diet, this translates to at least **28 grams of fiber per day**. High fiber intake benefits blood glucose control (diabetes), satiety (obesity), blood pressure (hypertension), and cholesterol lowering (high cholesterol).
