## Daily Nutritional Requirements by Condition

| Condition | Sugar (g/day) | Protein (g/day) | Fat (g/day) | Carbohydrates (g/day) | Fiber (g/day) |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Diabetes | ≤ 25 (women), ≤ 36 (men) | 0.8-1.0 g/kg body weight | 20-35% of calories (≤ 7% from saturated fat) | 45-60% of calories (200-225g) | ≥ 25-30 |
| Obesity | ≤ 25 (women), ≤ 36 (men) | 1.2-1.6 g/kg body weight | 20-35% of calories (≤ 7% from saturated fat) | 45-60% of calories (complex carbs) | ≥ 25-30 |
| Hypertension | ≤ 25 (women), ≤ 36 (men) | 0.8 g/kg body weight | 20-35% of calories (≤ 6% from saturated fat) | 45-65% of calories (complex carbs) | 30-35 |
| High Cholesterol | ≤ 25 (women), ≤ 36 (men) | 0.8 g/kg body weight | 25-35% of calories (≤ 6% from saturated fat) | 45-65% of calories (complex carbs) | ≥ 25-30 |

## Condition-Specific Dietary Recommendations

### Diabetes
- Limit added sugars to ≤ 6% of total daily calories
- Focus on high-quality carbohydrates (whole grains, legumes, vegetables)
- Include heart-healthy fats (mono and polyunsaturated)
- Distribute carbohydrates throughout the day for better glycemic control
- Sodium intake should be limited to < 2,300 mg/day

### Obesity
- Create a moderate calorie deficit (500-750 kcal/day for weight loss)
- Higher protein intake may help preserve lean mass during weight loss
- Focus on foods with low energy density and high nutrient density
- Limit refined carbohydrates and added sugars
- Regular meal timing may support weight management

### Hypertension
- Follow DASH diet principles (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)
- Limit sodium to 1,500-2,300 mg/day
- Emphasize potassium-rich foods (fruits, vegetables, legumes)
- Include calcium and magnesium-rich foods
- Limit alcohol consumption

### High Cholesterol
- Limit saturated fat to < 6% of total calories
- Eliminate trans fats when possible
- Include foods with plant sterols/stanols
- Focus on soluble fiber sources (oats, barley, legumes)
- Consider including fatty fish for omega-3 fatty acids
